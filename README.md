**authors:** fayth quinn ([*@losingfayth*](https://github.com/losingfayth)), drue coles

This program implements three path-finding algorithms,
 * A **Recursive** Algorithm, finding the path using traditional recursion
 * A **Recursive Backtracking** Algorithm, finding the path using recursion and backtracking when a path cannot be found
 * A **Dynamic Programming** Algorithm, finding the path from the bottom up


## Context
The program was created as part of a school project. This project was completed in ~3 days.

## Known Issues
n/a

## Feedback Received

* dc: The code could be simplified by ignoring empty cells in the pyramid
